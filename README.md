# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe game

My first Python project!

The aim of the project was to get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. I have also learned to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.
